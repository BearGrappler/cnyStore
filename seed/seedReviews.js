  writtenReview: 'This is the best lightweight laptop I\'ve used. It\'s perfect for light usage as a second computer. The 1.1 Ghz Intel Mobile M CPU is fast enough and lengthens the battery life over similar Windows laptops with Core i5 CPU\'s. Note that the laptop comes with battery fully discharged so you will have to charge the battery with the included AC adapter. It will not turn on without being plugged in when you first receive it.',

  writtenReview: 'I am never buying another Lenovo product. This is the second one I\'ve bought, the more fool me. The first one I returned instantly because it was defective, and I was stupid enough to assume that was just a fluke. The low price tag lured me into buying this one and it was a huge mistake, I should have been less cheap and bought something from a more trustworthy, competent company.',
